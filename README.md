# hotel_bookings_dataset
This is my excel project.
This is hotal booking dataset. First i saw data and cleaned the data.
I analysed what was most factor for cancelling booking.
I have created a dashboard in excel using PivotTable and Pivot chart for data analysis and visualization.
more than 60% of booking is cancelled for groups in total but for offline and online travel agent the booking cancellation is 34% and 37% respectively.
so final conclusion is need more focus on groups booking category. Some offer may given to groups category to stop the cancellation.
