# Brinda_hotel_bookings_dataset
Brinda wants to see what is reason for hotel booking cancellation is going high and what to do to stop the cancellation. This is hotel booking dataset. 
First, I saw data and cleaned the data. 
I analyzed what was most factor for cancelling booking. I have created a dashboard in excel using PivotTable and Pivot chart for data analysis and visualization.  
More than 60% of booking is cancelled for groups in total but for offline and online
travel agent the booking cancellation is 34% and 37% respectively. So
Final conclusion is to need more focus on groups booking category. 
Some offer may be given to groups category to stop the cancellation. 
This is my excel project.
