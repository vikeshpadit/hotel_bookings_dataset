# Brinda_hotel_bookings_dataset
Brinda wants to see what is reasion for hotla booking cancellation is going high and what to do to stop the cancellation.
This is hotal booking dataset. First i saw data and cleaned the data. I analysed what was most factor for cancelling booking. 
I have created a dashboard in excel using PivotTable and Pivot chart for data analysis and visualization. more than 60% of booking is cancelled for groups in total but for offline and online travel agent the booking cancellation is 34% and 37% respectively. so final conclusion is need more focus on groups booking category. Some offer may given to groups category to stop the cancellation.
This is my excel project.
